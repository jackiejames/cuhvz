<BR>

<div class="container">

<div class="row">

	<div class="six columns lightslide-box">

		<h2 class="subheadline white">1. Don’t be a Douchebag</h2>
		<p>
		Douchebaggery can include, but is not limited to…

		<ul>
		<li>Using non-players as cover/human shields,</li>

		<li>Removing your bandana, wristband, or conveniently choosing not to play, to avoid being killed, </li>

		<li>Denying that you were tagged/stunned (or claiming tags/stuns you didn’t get),</li>

		<li>Losing your temper, swearing, or generally acting like this is the actual apocalypse.
		</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	</div>

	<div class="six columns lightslide-box">

	<h2 class="subheadline white">2. Do not involve non-players in the game.</h2>
	<p>In other words,</p>
	<p>If someone isn’t wearing a bandana AND a wristband, do not tag them, do not throw socks at them, do not shoot them with marshmallows, and ESPECIALLY do not give them reason to feel threatened or in danger. </p>
	Our ability to hold this game is contingent on the fact that the CU community feels safe, even with a bunch of hooligans running around in bandanas. (More on this later from the CUPD).

	period.</h2>
	We know, it sucks. But those are the rules, and they’re for everyone’s safety.<br><br>

	In the past, HvZ has almost been banned entirely because of violations of this rule, so we must be absolutely, positively clear.

<h2 class="subheadline gray">So what can you use?</h2>
To combat the hordes, you have three options available to you on campus:
</div>

<div class="row darkslide-box">

	<div class="four columns">
	<h2 class="subheadline deepgrey">Sock-bombs. Simple and reliable.</h2>
	Sock bombs are made by rolling up a sock and taping it. These thrown projectiles never jam, and are easily recoverable.  An HvZ staple for 12 years. <BR><BR>
	</div>

	<div class="four columns">
	<h2 class="subheadline deepgrey">Blowguns. Slow, long-range firepower.</h2>
	PVC blowguns of no more than 3 feet may be used on campus. Over the years, these straightforward, long-range weapons have gotten gradually more elaborate. <BR><BR>
	</div>

	<div class="four columns">
	<h2 class="subheadline deepgrey">Marshmallow Blasters. Short-range, high ROF.</h2>
	This option is our compromise with CUPD. So long as marshmallow blasters are brightly colored, they may be used on campus. Marshmallow shooters may be recolored with paint or tape to make them legal, but they must not be darkly-colored or camouflage. If you’re unsure, contact the mod team.
